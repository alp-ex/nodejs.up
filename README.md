# NodeJS.up Repository

Welcome to the **NodeJS.up** repository. This repository is my playground to learn Node.js and its ecosystem. I will be documenting my learning journey, sharing resources, and creating flashcard sessions to help reinforce my learning.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into various sections, each focusing on a specific topic within the Node.js ecosystem. Here's an overview of what you can expect to find:

### Sections and Topics

1. **Modules**

### Resources

Each section contains resources file that is a gpt resume of what I learned during my journey to learn Node.js.

### Flashcard Sessions

To help reinforce your learning, we've included a script that generates flashcard sessions via GPT to test your knowledge and track your progress.
Use the following command to generate a flashcard session:

```bash
node <path-to-section>/flashcards.js(or mjs)
```
